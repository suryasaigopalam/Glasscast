Project: SwiftUI Weather App

Tech Stack:
- SwiftUI
- async/await
- Observation framework (@Observable)
- Supabase (auth + database)
- OpenWeatherMap API

Rules:
- ViewModel is the single source of truth
- Views must not contain business logic
- State mutations must happen on the main actor
- Use Environment(ViewModel.self) for injection
- Do not duplicate shared state in views
- Fix logic bugs before refactoring
- Explain root cause before suggesting code

API Rules:
- OpenWeatherMap units:
  - metric = Celsius
  - imperial = Fahrenheit
- Do not invent API parameters

Debugging Rules:
- Trace execution flow step-by-step
- Check guard conditions
- Verify async calls are triggered
- Verify state is actually mutated
- Do not guess
